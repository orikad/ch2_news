# Channel 2 live news
Channel 2 news in Israel can be streamed only with Flash on Windows.

This python script extracts the current live stream and prints it (also on OS X it plays it with QuickTime).

(the logic used was reversed out of the ch2 iOS app)

Also available as a web endpoint - http://orikad.com/cgi-bin/play_news2.py  (HTTP redirects to the stream)
